#Generative NFT Marketplace

This app allows users to mint customizable generative NFT artworks and trade them on a gasless marketplace.
Tech Stack

    Framework: Next.js
    Generative Art: p5.js
    Metadata/Minting: Moralis
    Marketplace: Zora Protocol

Overview

The goal is to provide a platform for creating unique NFTs from composable generative art pieces. Artists can mix and match visual elements to mint new creations.

Buyers can then purchase the NFTs on a gasless marketplace powered by Zora's Layer 2 protocol. This provides fast and inexpensive trading.

The frontend allows connecting a wallet to mint or purchase NFTs with cryptocurrency. Moralis handles metadata storage and onchain minting abstraction.
